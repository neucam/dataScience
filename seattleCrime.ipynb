Urban core population ramps up during the day as non-urban core residents make their way into the urban core during working/shopping hours, and typically exit in the evening.  Non-violent crime appears to vary much more dramatically than violent crime, as a function of hour within the day.  We will explore this relationship further, with the next chart showing the ratio of violent to non-violent crime as a function of hour within the day."
